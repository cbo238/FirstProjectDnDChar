		Introduction</h2>

	<p>This is my DnD character from a campaign I'm in with some friends from NYU. We started during the middle of the Fall 2021 semester and have kept playing since. This is just going to be a little character page for the character I play in the campaign!</p>

	<h2 style="font-family: papyrus;">Appearance</h2>

	<p>He stands at a whopping 3'11" (above average for male gnomes) with a mess of short silvery hair on the top of his head flowing into a long full beard almost fully covering his mouth. His piercing green eyes like two small gems contrasting his rough slightly sunburnt brown skin  Dressed in traditional pirate garments which included a baggy white poets shirt, dark sea stained trousers, a large handwoven gold sash across the waist, and classic faded brown leather Cavalier boots. The defining feature of his garments, however, is the slightly oversized and heavily worn navy blue frock coat which is embellished with silver buttons and gold embroidery. Woven onto the front right breast of the coat is the skull and crossed swords insignia of his home ship, the Rum Runner, whose swords featured vines wrapping around leading to the eyes of the skull.</p>

	<h2 style="font-family: papyrus;">Backstory</h2>
	
	<p>Growing up in an impoverished costal fishing town with only his sick mother as his father had passed just before he was born, Yosryn had to fight and find cleaver ways to provide for him and his loved ones. By the age of 14 he developed a quick wit and other survival skills while at the same time trying to improve his mind through books. Life seemed fine for a while being able to provide food and shelter for him and his mother, however, this was not enough to keep the life in his mothers breath. After her death, he lost the house and ended up an orphaned kid on the streets begging around for any food or money people could spare. He took refuge in an abandoned fish storage locker near the docking yards that were once bustling with dozens of fishermen and ships from all around.
	<br>One night, about half a year since his mom had passed, he was woken up by a loud noise coming from the docks. The sound was that of pirates who were drunkenly gathered around a fire passing around rum and singing sailors tunes about their most recent adventures. After sneaking up to the circle pirates he asked if they had any food to spare and to his surprise in their drunken frenzy they embraced him and said he had to celebrate with them first. Thus began Yosryn's friendship with the crew of the Rum Runner. For the next 50 years he worked his way up the crew ladder helping them loot ships across the seven seas, find long lost treasure, and travel to every coast city in realm. He also of course learned how to drink rum like his rowdy crewmates. He owed everything to this crew and never forgot that through all the adventures they went through. Wanting to repay them for saving his life all those years ago, he decided to search for the long sought after Map of Exceous the Black. However, the night he embarked on his solo voyage a terrible storm hit wreaking his ship and sending him a drift on the vast ocean away.
	<br>After a few days of floating around he found himself washed up on the shore of his old home town which had now been abandoned for years. The buildings in the town looked as if they could collapse at any second with splintered wood sticking out and mold crawling throughout the town. While walking through the town he stumbled onto the ruins that were his childhood home. As he made his way to where his mothers room would have been, he sees a faint shimmering coming from a purple book with gold embroidery under a tattered mattress. After brushing off the dust from the cover he could make out the script of his father on the title which read "Spell Book of Lemplon." This realization that his father was once a wizard lead Yosryn to travel inland and learn more about spellcasting, Arcana, and the history of wizardry. For the last 9 years he's been studying and traveling, growing in his knkowldge in hopes of one day using his powers to find the Map of Exceous and return back home to his crew.</p>
